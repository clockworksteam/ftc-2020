All motors run forwards
All angles are pozitive trigonometric oriented

Line(alpha, speed):
alpha ~ direction [-180, 180] (deg)
speed ~ speed [0, max_speed] m/sec
V1 = (speed / max_speed) * cos(alpha + 45)
V2 = (speed / max_speed) * sin(alpha + 45)
V3 = -(speed / max_speed) * sin(alpha + 225)
V4 = -(speed / max_speed) * cos(alpha + 225)

Rotation(ags):
ags ~ angular speed [0, max_ags] (deg/sec)
V1 = -ags / max_ags
V2 = ags / max_ags
V3 = -ags / max_ags
V4 = ags / max_ags


Motor V's from Line and Rotation can be summed:
To execute circular movement:
    alpha, speed, ags ~ constants, time ~ time since began circle/spiral
    for circle use alpha = 0
    Line(alpha, speed) + Rotation(ags) ~ circle/spiral, R = (360 * speed * cos(alpha)) / (ags * 2 * pi) - speed * sin(alpha) * time
To execute line movenent while rotating around own axis:
    alpha, speed, ags ~ constants, time ~ time since began movement
    Line(alpha - ags * time, speed) + Rotation(ags)
    OR
    speed ~ constant, gyro ~ gyroscope correction, AGS variable in time
    Line(gyro, speed) + Rotation(AGS)
