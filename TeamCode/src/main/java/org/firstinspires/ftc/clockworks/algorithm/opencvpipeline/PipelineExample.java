/*
 * An example image processing pipeline to be run upon receipt of each frame from the camera.
 * Note that the processFrame() method is called serially from the frame worker thread -
 * that is, a new camera frame will not come in while you're still processing a previous one.
 * In other words, the processFrame() method will never be called multiple times simultaneously.
 *
 * However, the rendering of your processed image to the viewport is done in parallel to the
 * frame worker thread. That is, the amount of time it takes to render the image to the
 * viewport does NOT impact the amount of frames per second that your pipeline can process.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: this pipeline is NOT invoked on your OpMode thread. It is invoked on the
 * frame worker thread. This should not be a problem in the vast majority of cases. However,
 * if you're doing something weird where you do need it synchronized with your OpMode thread,
 * then you will need to account for that accordingly.

     * each time through processFrame(). This removes the danger of causing a memory leak
     * by forgetting to call mat.release(), and it also reduces memory pressure by not
     * constantly allocating and freeing large chunks of memory.
